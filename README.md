# The Amnesia Project

The Amnesia Project is an effort to create a permanent,
open-source productivity client. It is intended to be the
final solution and final version of the ‘Productivity App”
project. It’s designed to work in all web browsers and
includes a variety of useful features for all users. 

## FAQ

### What actually *is* this?

Similar to RC2 or R2K, The Amnesia Project is a web-based open-source productivity client with tons of customisability and custom content. It features apps, widgets and more.

### Why not just use RC2, R2K or XCR?

All of these clients have limitations; R2K is built on the C2K framework, RC2 has layers of compatibility issues and XCR is a desktop only experience that requires *some* knowledge of coding. The Amnesia Project hopes to negate all of these issues entirely.

### Why not just update the old clients?

That's the point; this project wants to ensure that, in future, we can just push updates to this platform. In essence, this is the final version of the productivity app project.

### What's new?

The Amnesia Project features:

- Interactive Infobar, an infobar at the top of the screen that combines profile picture, time, name and navigation tools.
- Widgets V2: New baked-in widgets with no title bar that let you do more.
- Home Screen V2: A new version of the home screen that uses Widgets V2 to present weather, news and more.
- RX Codebase: TAP is built on the RX Codebase, a modified and still growing branch of the RC2 Codebase.
- Changelog: Read the newest features directly through the app.
- Backwards Compatibility: All RC2 widgets have been imported into TAP.

### How will versions work?

Simple;

- Large updates (new themes, many new features) will increase by v1.0.
- Smaller updates will increase by v0.10.
- Tiny improvements or small fixes will increase by v0.01.

### Download?

Currently, The Amnesia Project is still being worked on. We aim to release v0.1-alpha soon.

You will be able to download the project through the GitHub releases tab, or use the publically available version.
